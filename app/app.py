xExcess medical expenses may be considered for reimbursement at the Medical Committee's discretion. Overseas medical insurance is provided for official travel purposes.

Keywords this policy includes: health benefits, medical reimbursement, medical budget, hospitalization, illness, treatment, wellness, maternity, dental, vaccination.

Travel Expenses Policy: The ITC Travel Expenses Policy provides guidelines for official travel, covering transit accommodations, reimbursements, and daily allowances. Eligibility applies to Managers (Level 7 and above) and Office Associates, with travel class and allowances based on grades. Reimbursements include fixed and actual expenses for accommodations, food, and incidentals, with specific provisions for ITC and non-ITC hotels. Overseas travel allowances are specified in US dollars by grade. Claims require proper documentation, including tickets, invoices, and payment proofs.

Claims require proper invoices and must meet minimum billing thresholds. Coverage includes various ITC divisions such as food, personal care, and hotels, excluding tobacco, consumer durables, and non-ITC products. Promotions or employment changes adjust eligibility. Misuse or false claims can result in disciplinary action. Unused limits cannot be carried forward, and claims must be submitted by April 5th of the following financial year.

Keywords this policy includes: excess claims, future entitlements, product usage, sampling arrangement, feedback, ITC products, reimbursement for products, eligible employees, gifting products, purchase invoices, product categories.

If the above policies are not matched, give "No such policy found".

When presented with a question, accurately classify it as policy name to which it belongs.
NOTE: only give policy name. No description is required, no enter or any other expression with the policy name

              - Compliance requirements

           d) Recommendations:
              - Clear, actionable advice
              - Employee well-being considerations
              - Required follow-ups

           e) Concise Summary

        For every question, you should think in the above way but don't give the answers in the above format.

        User's Question: "{user_query}"
        User's grade: "{grade}"
        User's responsibility level: "{resp_level}"
        User's division: "{division}"
        User's info: {user_info}

        Reference Data: {context_for_llm}

        While giving numbers like Medical Domiciliary (Rs.),Medical Hospitalisation (Rs.),Hospital Room Entitlement, Product Sampling (Rs.)
        and other personalized numbers, please use the user_info to generate the response, not the numbers that you get from the policy itself.
        That is if anything which is mentioned in the policy document, is also mentioned in the user_info, then use the user_info to generate the response.
        
        While giving answers, please use simple english, short format answer in proper bulleting format and give added perks where it is absolutely necessary.
        If there is some numbers associated in the response, try to put that figure in the response at the very top and then followed by the rest.
        Start the response with a conclusive statement (don't start with Based on the information)and then followed by the rest of the response.
        Example Response Format:
        Question: "Does the leave policy include work from home days?"
        Answer: "No, the leave policy does not include work from home days."

        Question: "How many leaves remaining?"
        Answer: Based on {user_info}:
        - Annual Entitlement: 26 leaves
        - Carry Forward Limit: 7 leaves
        - Remaining Available: [26 - 7 - N] leaves
